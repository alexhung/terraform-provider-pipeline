## Versioning

In general, this project follows [semver](https://semver.org/) as closely as we can for tagging releases of the package. We've adopted the following versioning policy:

* We increment the **major version** with any incompatible change to functionality, including changes to the exported Go API surface or behavior of the API.
* We increment the **minor version** with any backwards-compatible changes to functionality.
* We increment the **patch version** with any backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Contributors

Pull requests, issues and comments are welcomed. For pull requests:

* Add tests for new features and bug fixes
* Follow the existing style
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests

See the existing issues for things to start contributing.

For bigger changes, make sure you start a discussion first by creating an issue and explaining the intended change.
