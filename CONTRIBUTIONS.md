# Contribution Guide

## Contributors
Pull requests, issues and comments are welcomed. For pull requests:

* Add tests for new features and bug fixes
* Follow the existing style
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests

See the existing issues for things to start contributing.

For bigger changes, make sure you start a discussion first by creating
an issue and explaining the intended change.

JFrog requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement,
known as a CLA. This serves as a record stating that the contributor is
entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project
and is willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works
(or is willing to transfer ownership).


## Build the Provider
Simply run `make install` - this will compile the provider and install it to `~/.terraform.d`. When running this, it will
take the current tag and bump it 1 minor version. It does not actually create a new tag (that is `make release`).
If you wish to use the locally installed provider, make sure your TF script refers to the new version number.

Requirements:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.15+ (to build the provider plugin)

### Building on macOS

This provider uses [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) as part of the build toolchain, in both Linux and macOS. This provides consistency across OSes.

If you are building this on macOS, you have two options:
- Install [gnu-sed using brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnu-sed), OR
- Use a Linux Docker image/container

#### Using gnu-sed

After installing with brew, get the GNU sed information:

```sh
$ brew info gnu-sed
```

You should see something like:
```
GNU "sed" has been installed as "gsed".
If you need to use it as "sed", you can add a "gnubin" directory
to your PATH from your bashrc like:

     PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```

Add the `gnubin` directory to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` per instruction so that `sed` command uses gnu-sed.


## Testing
Since JFrog Pipelines is an addon for Artifactory, you will need a running instance of the JFrog platform (Artifactory and Pipelines).
However, there is no currently supported dockerized, local version. The fastest way to install Artifactory and Pipelines as a self-hosted installation is to use Platform
Helm chart. Free 30 days trial version is available [here](https://jfrog.com/start-free/#hosted)
If you want to test on SaaS instance - [30 day trial can be freely obtained](https://jfrog.com/start-free/#saas)
and will allow local development.

You can then run the tests as `make acceptance`. You can check what it's doing on the background in the [GNUmakefile](GNUmakefile) in the project.

We've found that it's very convenient to use [Charles proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) to see the payload, generated by Terraform Provider during the testing process.
You can also use any other network packet reader, like Wireshark and so on.


## Registry documentation generation
All the documentation in the project is generated by [tfplugindocs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs).
If you make any changes to the resource schemas, you will need to re-generate documentation.
Install [tfplugindocs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs#installation), then run:
```sh
$ make doc
```
